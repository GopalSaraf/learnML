**NOTE**: The repository is **under development** and is not ready for use.

## Introduction

LearnML is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python. Each algorithm is implemented as a class and is tested on different datasets.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide educational resources for understanding the inner workings of popular machine learning algorithms.

**Please note** that the algorithms in this repository are for educational purposes and may not be optimized for production use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/GopalSaraf/learnML`.
2. Navigate to the repository using `cd learnML`.
3. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
5. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Install the LearnML library using `pip install .`.

## Examples

Explore the examples in the `examples` folder to see how to use the algorithms. Each example showcases a specific algorithm on a sample dataset.

To run an example, navigate to the root folder and execute the following command:

```bash
python examples/<example_name>.py
```
