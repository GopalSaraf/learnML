## Introduction

LearnML is a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python. Each algorithm is encapsulated as a class and thoroughly tested across different datasets.

The primary objective of this repository is to provide educational resources that facilitate a deep understanding of the internal mechanisms governing popular machine learning algorithms.

It is essential to emphasize that the algorithms included in this repository are intended for educational purposes and might not be optimized for production environments.

## Installation

To get started with LearnML, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/GopalSaraf/learnML`.
2. Move into the repository directory: `cd learnML`.
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Install the LearnML library: `pip install .`.

## Documentation

LearnML's documentation is generated using pdoc.
